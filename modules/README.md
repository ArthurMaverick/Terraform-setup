# Terraform Modules
This repository contains Terraform modules for AWS

## What are Terraform modules?
Terraform modules are reusable pieces of code that allow you to create, configure, and manage infrastructure resources in a repeatable and consistent way. Modules can be shared and reused across different projects, making it easy to standardize infrastructure configurations and manage them at scale.

## AWS Modules
The AWS modules in this repository provide pre-built infrastructure resources that can be used to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud. These modules cover a range of AWS services, including EC2, S3, IAM, and more.

## How to use these modules
To use these modules, you will need to have Terraform installed on your machine. You can then include the modules in your Terraform configuration files by using the module block, like so.
